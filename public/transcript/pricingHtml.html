<p class="calibre1">it isn't cheap. but the alternative is not reading books at all. so the real question is: “is the content in this book worth more than what i'm spending?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">here's a cost breakdown: listening to a 500-page book like "thinking fast and slow" runs $8-10. if you have 1-2 minute conversations with every other paragraph (which is a lot), add another $15-25. so you're looking between $10-35 total to read and truly understand that book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">it's pay-as-you-go. add credits, they get used as you read and chat. you only pay for what you actually consume.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b>fair warning</b>: if watching money get spent makes you paranoid, this will stress you out. you'll be conscious of every page and conversation costing something. that kills the whole point – which is learning without friction. the things you learn should outweigh the cost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">i make 10% profit. the rest goes to google's gemini api and server costs. if you think it's too expensive, take it up with google and amazon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">the good news is the AI landscape is shaking. every 6 months there's a new “best" model, which means i'll either pass on lower costs or better experiences. sometimes both.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b>one more thing: the oath coin.</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">comes in three sizes: whisper ($1), fire ($4) and blood ($10). you commit this money upfront as a promise to actually read the book. it's your money – just locked until you finish (by marking the book as complete) and write a short summary of what you learned and plan to do. wonders happen when you have skin in the game.</p>
