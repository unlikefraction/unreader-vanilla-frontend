<p class="calibre1">i suck at reading. but i can binge 1hr MIT lectures and enjoy every minute of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">if that doesn’t sound like you, i’ll save you the trouble: this isn’t for you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">if you’re in the remaining group of people who love learning but despite knowing the last 1500 years of human knowledge lives in books, you just can’t fucking get through one! hi, we’re about to be best friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">here’s what i figured out: i understand better when i listen than when i read. audible solves that. but books are dense, packed with references to things that happened before my great-great-grandfather was born, using words that feel like archaeological discoveries. every time i hit something i don’t know, it gets easier and easier to just… close the book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">so i built something different.</p>
<p class="calibre1">you upload an epub (please buy it so the author gets paid). we use the best text-to-speech models to read it to you – realistic voices, not robot torture. but here’s the magic: you can interrupt anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">i call it “holdup”, while listening, you pause and ask the AI anything. what does this word mean? who’s this person they’re referencing? can you explain this entire paragraph that just flew over my head? it’s like having the author sitting next to you, patiently answering every “wait, what?” moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">why not just use chatgpt or notebookLM? because i want to read the actual book, not a summary. the author spent years writing this. when i spend time with each paragraph, asking questions, diving deeper – i grow fonder of their ideas. most summaries i forget by tomorrow. this way, i actually implement what i learn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">i know trusting a new product is hard. so here’s $5 credit to try it: go to account > billing, use code “I-UNREAD-IT-ALL”</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheers to us – the ones who can’t sleep well unless we learned something new that day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">let’s go →</p>
